What I Learned

How to import a dataset into Power BI and perform the necessary data transformations.

Understood the basics of time series analysis by watching a tutorial.

Learned how to format charts and dashboards (backgrounds, titles, colors).

Practiced using slicers and filters to make dashboards more interactive.

Reflection

I explored concepts mainly through YouTube tutorials.

The tutorials helped me gain clarity on designing dashboards and making them look professional.

Going forward, I plan to apply these techniques to my own datasets for hands-on practice.
