Task 1 – Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
What I Learned Today

How to import data into the Power Query Editor in Excel.

How to rename columns properly for consistency.

How to handle null and empty values (using replace/remove options).

Reflection

I started working late on the task, so I couldn’t fully clean the dataset.

However, I understood the basic steps of data cleaning in Excel, which I will improve in future tasks.
